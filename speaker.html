This has brought the spotlight onto security and privacy concerns with machine learning (ML), generating tremendous interest among researchers. In this talk, I will discuss two meta issues ML security and privacy that merits greater attention from the research community. The first is the question of whether we are using the right adversary models. As a case study, I will use model ownership resolution (MOR) schemes that are intended to deter "model theft." The second is the issue of conflicts that arise when protection mechanisms for multiple different threats need to be applied simultaneously to a given ML model.

                                    <p align="justify" style="width: 95%;"> Data is today even more critical than ever as not only supports operational functions of organizations, but it is a gold mine for strategic decisions and predictions, via the use of advanced machine learning techniques. Data is thus today immensely valuable. However, despite more than 40 years of research on data security and privacy, data breaches keep increasing. Malicious actors use sophisticated attack strategies, based on multiple steps and tools, such as infostealers and Trojan, and on detailed intelligence about organizations applications, key individuals, and defenses. Recent attacks show that now attackers target software supply chains so to easily gain access to large numbers of organizations.  It is important to mention that current database technology, e.g. relational database management systems (DBMSs), provides excellent data protection techniques for data stored in databases, including fine-grained content and context-based access control, protections from database administrators, full database encryption, and always-encrypted database, also leveraging hardware and software secure enclaves. And yet, we will see a lot of data breaches. One reason for this situation is that, even if the data is well protected by the DBMS, once the data leaves the database to be handed to applications, which are often not secure, it is not any longer protected. An example of such insecure applications is represented by the ones prone to SQL injection.  One would have expected that applications would today be free of such a long-known vulnerability. However, the number of SQL vulnerabilities accepted as common vulnerabilities and exposures remains high even in recent years. In the talk, after discussing relevant examples of data breaches to show some of the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by malicious actors to steal data, I will discuss the problem of insecure database applications and approaches to enhance their security. Then I will provide my own broader perspective on challenges and approaches to comprehensive data security, including the role of recent artificial intelligence techniques.

                                    <p align="justify" style="width: 95%;"> AI is becoming (again) a central theme in computing and obviously there are also security and privacy issues in AI deployment (like any other new computing technology). The nature of AI is that it moves fast and changes the computing landscape in major ways, and industry is committed to using it in the future. Certainly AI is in a need of having security to assure its success and have cryptography be part of it. Further, besides technological deployment, AI possesses some fundamental modeling questions and its understanding, at times, is a challenge as well.
                                    <p align="justify" style="width: 95%;"> In this survey talk I will cover some points where AI and Cryptography touch, in practice and in theoretical works, and I will cover some issues on how the areas influence each other, and what are the issues where they can help or hurt each other.

                                    <p align="justify" style="width: 95%;"> We are currently experiencing a significant and widespread digital transformation across all sectors of our economy. This transformation is driven by the rapid emergence and adoption of critical technologies, particularly Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). Research has shown that AI and ML systems can be vulnerable to various attacks, which raises significant concerns when these systems are used in critical services and infrastructures, posing threats to the national economy.
                                    <p align="justify" style="width: 95%;"> It is essential to develop AI and ML systems that can be trusted. Trustworthiness has two dimensions: true trustworthiness, which reflects a system's reliability, and perceived trustworthiness, which indicates how reliable a system appears to users. This presentation will explore the journey from true to perceived trustworthiness of AI and ML systems, highlighting the research challenges and initiatives undertaken at CSIRO’s Data61.

However, these emerging technologies also present novel attack surfaces, leading to covert data leakage. In this talk, I will discuss my team’s recent work on exploring non-intrusive side channels to uncover and understand hidden data leakage from these attack surfaces of mobile and IoT devices. Specifically, we will demonstrate the ability to infer user activities through wireless and power side channels and reconstruct user fingerprints from in-display fingerprint sensors in smartphones via the electromagnetic (EM) side channel without compromising either the hardware or software of the smartphones. Additionally, I will briefly outline potential mitigation strategies.

                                    <p align="justify" style="width: 95%;"> The growing complexity of deep neural network models in modern application domains (e.g., vision and language) necessitates a complex training process that involves extensive data, sophisticated design, and substantial computation. These inherently encapsulate the intellectual property (IP) of data and model owners, highlighting the urgent need to protect privacy, ensure model robustness, and safeguard proprietary rights of model owners during development, deployment, and post-deployment stages. In this talk, we will present our recent research surrounding holistic strategies for privacy preservation, model robustness verification, and model usage control, addressing challenges across the entire model lifecycle. Our approaches aim to advance responsible AI practice by ensuring secure and ethical utilization of AI systems.

This has brought the spotlight onto security and privacy concerns with machine learning (ML), generating tremendous interest among researchers. In this talk, I will discuss two meta issues ML security and privacy that merits greater attention from the research community. The first is the question of whether we are using the right adversary models. As a case study, I will use model ownership resolution (MOR) schemes that are intended to deter "model theft." The second is the issue of conflicts that arise when protection mechanisms for multiple different threats need to be applied simultaneously to a given ML model.

Satisfying the demand is not easy, especially in the context of modern databases. The difficulty lies in how to perform the database query processing over encrypted data while meeting the requirements of security, performance, and complex query functions. In this talk, we will take a retrospective view on encrypted database research. The area has received tremendous advancements over the past decade, with proposals based on cryptographic designs and hardware enclaves. We will overview these latest advancements and the potential challenges, e.g., leakage-abuse attacks, and discuss the possible roadmap ahead towards practically more secure, efficient and functional encrypted databases.

                                    <p align="justify" style="width: 95%;"> Protocols for secure multi-party computation (MPC), dating back to the 1980s, allow multiple parties to jointly evaluate any efficiently computable function on their private inputs without revealing anything beyond the function's output. However, generic MPC protocols often incur significant computational and communication overhead, making them impractical for real-world use. To address this challenge, pseudorandom correlation generators (PCGs) enable MPC with silent preprocessing, where a communication-efficient, input-independent preprocessing phase is followed by a lightweight online phase. In this talk, I will introduce PCGs, discuss their applications, and provide an overview of recent advancements in the field.

<!--                            <p align="justify" style="width: 95%;"> Over the past decade, mobile and IoT devices have undergone rapid development, introducing innovative technologies that enhance daily life convenience. However, these emerging technologies also present novel attack surfaces, leading to covert data leakage. In this talk, I will discuss my team’s recent work on exploring non-intrusive side channels to uncover and understand hidden data leakage from these attack surfaces of mobile and IoT devices. Specifically, we will demonstrate the ability to infer user activities through wireless and power side channels and reconstruct user fingerprints from in-display fingerprint sensors in smartphones via the electromagnetic (EM) side channel without compromising either the hardware or software of the smartphones. Additionally, I will briefly outline potential mitigation strategies.-->
